Usage
---

Use `yarn install` to install dependencies and `yarn build` to build the JS bundle. The `www` directory contains HTML files and other static assets. The `www/js` directory contains the generated bundle and is removed by `yarn clean`.
In short:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn build`
- Serve files from `www` (`yarn serve`) and open in browser
